CS361 WEBAPP project

Instructions to run project:
1. Clone the project to local directory of choice. It will be called CS361_Team_Double_A
2. All project files will be located in: CS361_Team_Double_A/book_webframe/
3. In command line navigate to a NEW folder where you would like to run the website from.
    A. Enter in terminal:  
       npx create-react-app double_a_app (double_a_app will be the folder to run the website from).
4.
