CS361 WEBAPP project

Instructions to setup and run project:
1. Clone the project to local directory of choice. It will be called CS361_Team_Double_A
2. Go to the cloned local directory CS361_Team_Double_A/book_webframe/<br>
3. Enter in command line: `npm install`<br>
4. Enter in command line: `npm start` to launch website<br>


Alternative in case above instructions don't work:<br>
1. In command line navigate to a NEW folder where you would like to run the website from.
    A. Enter in terminal:  
       npx create-react-app double_a_app (double_a_app will be the folder to run the website from).
2. Now, copy ALL the files located in the CLONED directory (CS361_Team_Double_A/book_webframe), into the newly created folder “double_a_app/” (the copied files SHOULD CONSIST OF public directory, src directory, .gitignore, README.md and package.json). This will replace the src and public directory that was created automatically when creating the react-app, and replace it with our files.
3. Make sure you are still in folder double_a_app/
4. In command line npm install:<br>
    A. npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap<br>
    B. npm install react-router-dom<br>
    C. npm install --save reactstrap react react-dom<br>
    D. npm install react-flexy-table<br>
5. Again make sure to still be in folder double_a_app/
6. Enter in command line:  npm start (to launch the website)
